# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

Soledad is a Unity project (Editor `6000.3.15f1`, HDRP) for one piece in two forms: a fulldome short film
(also exported in 16:9) and a 45 min live performance where Gamgie speaks the text and plays the visuals live over
recorded music. Everything is driven from Chataigne over OSCQuery. The film is edited in DaVinci Resolve, with some
effects added in TouchDesigner. Everything in this repo is written in English.

The visual engine is **Oxipital**, installed as two packages by git URL and tag (`Packages/manifest.json`):
`com.gamgie.oxipital.core` and `com.gamgie.oxipital.camera` from
[Oxipital-Packages](https://github.com/Gamgie/Oxipital-Packages). Their architecture and packaging rules are in that
repository's `CLAUDE.md`. Engine features (anything generic, such as a light ballet or a render type blend) are
developed in [Oxipital-Engine](https://github.com/Gamgie/Oxipital-Engine), released with a new tag, then picked up
here by changing `#vX.Y.Z` in the manifest. Never edit the package copies under `Library/PackageCache`.

Soledad is the first show project built this way: it must never depend on Oxipital-Engine's `Assets`.

## The show: five acts

| # | Scene | Act |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Assets/Scenes/Acts/Act1_BeyondTheVeil.unity` | Beyond the Veil: screens, smoke, a Tron-like digital world |
| 2 | `Assets/Scenes/Acts/Act2_Flythrough.unity` | Flythrough: a bird's flight over desert, mountains, the Bogotá valley |
| 3 | `Assets/Scenes/Acts/Act3_Abyss.unity` | Abyss: lit particles, noise architectures, volumetric light, flocking |
| 4 | `Assets/Scenes/Acts/Act4_SeeThrough.unity` | See Through: the tree, insects, the invisible links |
| 5 | `Assets/Scenes/Acts/Act5_MementoMori.unity` | Memento Mori: Earth from the Moon, light ballet, gold and violet finale |

The moodboard, intentions and text of each act are in Notion (Art > Soledad > Création > Moodboard).

## Scene architecture

- `Assets/Scenes/Soledad_Main.unity` is always loaded and is the active scene. It holds everything permanent:
  - `Root Scene`: the object OSCQuery exposes (`OSCQuery.rootObject`), so Chataigne addresses start under it, as in
    Oxipital-Engine (the Chataigne module looks for a top-level `ballet`). It contains `Cameras` (Oxipital Camera
    prefab), `Ballet` (Oxipital Core prefab), `Show` (`ShowController`), `Sun`, `Sky and Fog Volume`, and the loaded
    acts.
  - `OSCQuery`: server `Unity-Oxipital` on port 8999, same filters as Oxipital-Engine.
  - `Dome Creator` (pfc dome-tools): the fulldome rig. `CameraController.isFullDome` switches between the dome
    (main camera off, `Dome Creator` renders `Assets/Textures/Dome Content Texture` and the DomeMaster
    `Dome Output Texture`) and 16:9 (`Dome Creator` disabled). `DomeCameraRigFollow` on its rig follows
    `Cameras/Main Camera` through `Dome Target`. Wired like Oxipital-Engine's `Oxipital Dome` scene.
- Each act is its own scene with **one root object named like the scene, carrying an `Act` component**. Only
  environment content goes there (meshes, terrain, point clouds, lights, local Volumes, act-specific scripts).
- `ShowController` (`Assets/Scripts/Show`): OSCQuery only sees `Root Scene`, so an act scene is loaded additively,
  its root is moved under `Root Scene` in the main scene, and the emptied act scene is unloaded at once. Setting
  `act` (1 to 5, 0 = none; also `NextAct()` / `PreviousAct()`) crossfades `Act.weight` over `transitionDuration`,
  keeps only the shown act and the next one (preloaded, inactive), and destroys the others. Chataigne sees an act's
  objects after its next sync.
- `Act.weight` scales every Volume under the act, so two acts blend during a transition. Act-specific scripts read it
  to fade their own content.
- Working on an act in the Editor: open `Soledad_Main`, then the act scene additively. On Play, `ShowController`
  takes over the open act scene and shows it. Keep `Soledad_Main` as the active scene.
- Object names under `Root Scene` and public fields are Chataigne addresses: do not rename them casually.
- `Player Settings > Run In Background` is on (as in Oxipital-Engine): the show keeps running while Chataigne or
  TouchDesigner has the focus.

## Act content

Each act keeps its own assets in `Assets/Acts/<ActScene>/` (Scripts, Shaders, Materials), code in `namespace Soledad`.
Same performance rule as Oxipital: no allocation in `Update`, `Shader.PropertyToID` for material properties.
Each act root holds a `<ActScene> Volume` (global, priority 10, profile `<ActScene> Volume Profile.asset` in the
act folder) for the act's own look; `Act` scales its weight, so it crossfades with the act. Act 1: black gradient
sky, no bloom, fog off.

- **Act 1, `GridTunnel`** (`Assets/Acts/Act1_BeyondTheVeil/`): endless box tunnel of thin grid lines whose cells are
  "windows" that light up (random blink, or one solo window: the lonely lit window of a building at night), deformed
  by a fractal noise like a Noise SOP. The script builds the dense mesh on the child `Grid Tunnel Mesh` (not saved
  in the scene) and slides it in whole cells to follow the camera named "Main Camera"; grid, blink and noise are
  computed in tunnel space so the slide is invisible. Two line families appear on their own: rails (along the
  tunnel, grow from the camera towards the end) and rings (around it, grow from the middle of the floor up both
  sides), each with a growth speed, a start delay spread, an order (Chase, Reverse, Random, Mirror) and a light
  effect modelled on Blux effects (None, Sine, Noise, Pulse, Saw: phase = time x speed - spread x line order). Shader `Soledad/GridTunnel` is a hand-written HDRP unlit shader
  on HDRP's own passes (`DepthForwardOnly`, `ForwardOnly`, `SceneSelectionPass`), deforming vertices through the
  `HAVE_MESH_MODIFICATION` hook of `VertMesh.hlsl`; the displacement depends on position only so walls never crack
  at the corners. Its time is accumulated from `Time.deltaTime` (deterministic Recorder renders). Do not reference
  objects of `Soledad_Main` from an act scene (cross-scene references are dropped on save): find them at run time.

## Film workflow: perform, then render

The film is rendered offline, slower than real time, so it cannot be driven by Chataigne live. Each act is
performed live with Chataigne (gamepad for the camera, Leap for the hands) against the recorded music at preview
resolution, the values reaching Unity are recorded into a Timeline, then Unity Recorder renders that Timeline at full
resolution (image sequences for Resolve). Camera moves can also be written directly in the Timeline. Keep VFX seeds
fixed so re-renders match. Inputs that are not recorded (Leap, Spout, optical flow) do not reach the film.

## Commits

`.asset`, `.glb` and other binaries go through Git LFS (`.gitattributes`). Commit act scenes together with any new
`.meta` files. Never commit `Library`, `Temp`, `Logs`, `UserSettings` or the generated `.csproj` / `.slnx` files
(already in `.gitignore`).
